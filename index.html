      <p>
        Born in the early 2020s, we leveraged the power of AI to choose our name
        which in turn set the direction of our agency. With AI at the start and
        the heart of our agency, we decided to harness the power of AI to make
        code kinder. What does "making code kinder" mean? We don't really know
        but it sounds good.
